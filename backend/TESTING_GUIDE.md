# üß™ Complete Testing Guide for Mood Journal App

## üìã **Overview**
This guide teaches you how to systematically test every feature of your mood journal app, from basic health checks to advanced AI recommendations.

## üéØ **Testing Philosophy**
- **Start Simple**: Begin with basic connectivity
- **Test Incrementally**: Build up from simple to complex features
- **Verify Data**: Always check that data is saved and retrieved correctly
- **Test Edge Cases**: Try invalid inputs and error conditions
- **Document Results**: Keep track of what works and what doesn't

3. **Document everything**: Keep track of test results
4. **Automate when possible**: Create test scripts
5. **Test regularly**: Run tests after every change

### **Sample Test Script**:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# test_mood_journal.sh

echo "üß™ Starting Mood Journal Tests..."

# Health check
echo "1. Testing health check..."
curl -s http://localhost:8080/health | jq '.'

# Login
echo "2. Testing login..."
TOKEN=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8080/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"identifier": "testuser", "password": "password123"}' \
  | jq -r '.token')

echo "Token: $TOKEN"

# Log mood
echo "3. Testing mood logging..."
